1. Visual Style & Aesthetic Direction
a) Clean & Minimal Visual Language
    • Favor generous whitespace and clear separation between cards and screen sections.
    • Prioritize readable typography with well-defined hierarchy for titles, labels, and meta information.
    • Use clean card-based layouts for core lists (games, batches, tournaments).
Examples show high emphasis on layout clarity and visual breathing room. 
Instruction:
    • Headline text should be 24–32px with weight for emphasis.
    • Subtext body text should be 14–16px for readability.
    • Use consistent padding (16–24pt) throughout the UI.

b) Bold Imagery and Contextual Media
All three inspirations use imagery or colorful backgrounds to convey context — important for visual engagement.
Instruction:
    • Use large, immersive hero images for key screens:
        ◦ Game detail view
        ◦ Tournament banners
        ◦ Coaching batch headers
    • Allow optional photo upload for user avatars + game/event images.

c) Vibrant Yet Controlled Color Accents
The travel UI uses vibrant accent colors against a mostly neutral palette, making CTAs (Call to Actions) highly visible. 
Instruction:
    • Core brand color for actions: one strong hue (e.g., grass green / sport blue).
    • Secondary color for highlights (e.g., orange/yellow) on badges, status tags.
    • Neutrals for background and surfaces (whites, light greys).

🧠 2. Interaction Patterns
a) Card-Based Exploration
Both Vaca and other related UI systems use card components as building blocks for discovery. 
Instruction:
Use cards consistently for:
    • Game listings
    • Trending games
    • Coaching batches
    • Tournament highlights
    • Feed events
Each card must have:
    • Title
    • Key meta (time, slots left, area)
    • Preview image or icon
    • CTA (Join / Details / Enroll)

b) Modern Tab Navigation
Tute and Vaca inspirations show strong modular flows without clutter — achieved with segmented or tabbed navigation. 
Instruction:
    • Use bottom or top tabs for primary sections:
        ◦ Feed / Search
        ◦ Games
        ◦ Coaching
        ◦ Tournaments
        ◦ Profile
    • Ensure active tab highlights with brand accent color.

c) Contextual micro-interactions
Micro animations reinforce action success or activity completion.
Examples like animated transitions and button highlights in these designs create delight without overwhelming.
Instruction:
    • Subtle button press animations
    • Smooth card transitions
    • Feedback on completed actions (e.g., game joined, batch enrolled)

🚀 5. UX Principles to Uphold
    1. Progressive Onboarding: First-time users guided through key actions.
    2. Action-First Screen Layout: Prioritize CTAs with immediate visibility.
    3. Micro-feedback: Transitions that confirm action success.
    4. Simple Filters: Game search by area/sport/time without deep menus.
    5. Responsive Layouts: Web-first but mobile-optimized interactions.

🧠 Design Pattern References
    • Card-based lists for actionable items
    • Tabbed sections for main navigation
    • Hero imagery for context-rich screens
    • Icon-supported metadata (date, time, slots)
    • Visual hierarchy informed by typographic scale
These reflect modern mobile UI paradigms seen across social, travel, and learning apps — which prioritize clarity, engagement, and focus on key behaviors (discovery, action, engagement).
